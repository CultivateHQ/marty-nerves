# MartyControl

Controls Marty The Robot.

Ultimately this will go ona  Pi Zero, running Nerves, possibly inside Marty's head.

Initial goals are:

* Connect via TCP socket on port 24
* Send commands via IEX
* Create web interface

Stretch

* Camera
* Control over UART rather than socket

Subsequent things:

* Control via server on internet, so Flossie can control Marty from anywhere
* Camera display make sense for remote control
